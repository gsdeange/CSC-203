CPE 203 Assignment 7 by: Garrett DeAngelis

1) To trigger the storm, press anywhere within the world using the mouse. The storm will spawn on 9 tiles.

2) When the storm spawns, it will create a new background with storm clouds.

3) If a miner passes into the storm or the storm is triggered above a miner, then the miner will change form into Scooby Doo.
   Scooby will then run around faster than the normal miners and gobble up all of the ore. Since he's Scooby Doo, 
   he is always hungry and therefore won't ever stop eating the ore.
 

4) The entity produced by the storm is the ghost, but only if a miner is changed into Scooby Doo (eg. passes into the storm). 
   These ghosts will run around and hunt down the ore blobs.
