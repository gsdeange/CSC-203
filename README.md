# CSC-203
Object Oriented Programming in Java

Course completed Spring 2018 with Professor Bill Foote.

Most of the Projects in this class have to do with code refactoring of a Java graphical game/world provided to us.
As such, not all of the code was completely written by me, especially in the earlier projects. 

Projects:

2 - Basic file refactoring
3 - UML modeling diagram
4 - Adding in different Entities
5 - Adding Interfaces
6 - Adding in Abstract classes
7 - Final Project: adding graphical features and other components
